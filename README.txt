**** WAR RULES ****

1. Divide deck evenly among players (26 cards to each player), giving each a down stack. 
2. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck, and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to the bottom of their stack
3. If two cards are played of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next card of their pile face down, and then another face up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all 6 cards to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats. 
4. If a player runs out of cards during a war, they immediately lose.
